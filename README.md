# RISC-V-Microprocessor-verilog-code-implementation-Artix-7-tested-with-Fibonacci-series-on-7seg
Here we are implementing Risc-V single cycle microprocessor on Basys3 (Artix-7) .We are testing with Fibonaccie Series and showing on 7 segment display..
Here we are using Vivado HLx software to generate bitstream for Basys3 kit and using Artix-7.
I have also shared .xdc file for basys3.You have to customize .xdc file according to your requirement.
